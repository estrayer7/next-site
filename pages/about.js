        <p className='text-lg'>Hello! I am Elijah Strayer and this is my personal website built with NextJS. Currently,
          I am a Senior at Bowling Green State University getting my Bachelors of Science in
          Software Engineering with a general science minor. When it comes to development, web and 
          mobile development are what excite me the most. Also, I am interning at Compassion International 
          as a software engineer for the summer of 2022. In my free time I enjoy teaching myself the guitar 
          or going fishing with my friends.
